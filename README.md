# Movie Recommendation System

## Overview
This project implements a movie recommendation system using collaborative filtering techniques. It analyzes the relationships between users and movies based on their ratings to suggest personalized movie recommendations.

## Files
- **movies.csv**: Contains information about movies including `movieId`, `title`, and `genres`.
- **credits.csv**: Contains details about movie credits including `movieId`, `cast`, `crew`, etc.

## Features
- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and preprocesses the movie data, handling missing values and transforming categorical data.
- **Collaborative Filtering**: Implements collaborative filtering algorithms such as user-based or item-based recommendation systems.
- **Evaluation**: Measures recommendation system performance using metrics like RMSE (Root Mean Squared Error) or MAE (Mean Absolute Error).
- **Deployment**: Provides options for deployment, such as API endpoints using Flask for real-time recommendations.

## Technologies Used
- Python
- Libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn (for evaluation), Flask (for API)

## Setup
1. **Clone the repository:**

2. **Install dependencies:**

3. **Download datasets:**
- Download `movies.csv` and `credits.csv` from your preferred movie dataset source and place them in the project directory.

4. **Run the project:**

## Usage
- **Training the Model:** Modify `train_model.py` to experiment with different collaborative filtering algorithms and parameters.
- **Testing:** Use `test_model.py` to evaluate the recommendation system's accuracy and performance.

## Acknowledgments
- Mention any datasets or libraries used for building the recommendation system.
- Credit sources for `movies.csv` and `credits.csv`.
